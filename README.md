# Unfinished, still on it!

Visual simulator of heat transmission based on the resulting equality of temperatures of both objects. Input two types of materials (materials available can be found in the list of materials file) and their initial tempratures and watch the heat transfer. 

The change of the temperatures is just an estimate. The movement of the object representing the "center of heat" is currently not working. I'm having a hard time syncing it with the temperature change. 

All the temperatures are in degrees celsius, specific heat capacities in Joules per kilogram Kelvin. Mass of both objects is 1 kg, this is resulting the mass to cancel out. Do not use any upper letters. You may use decimal numbers.
